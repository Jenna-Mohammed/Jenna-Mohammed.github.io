title: "About Me"
---

My name is Jenna Mohammed, and I am a first year Masters student at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health studying Epidemiology. I recently graduated from NYU where I studied Psychology and Pre-Medical Sciences. 

In my free time, I love to read, spend time with friends, and play the cello :) My favorite book series is Percy Jackson.
